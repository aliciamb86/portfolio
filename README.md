- **[Interstellar Travel Customer Satisfaction Analysis](https://github.com/aliciamb86/ML-interstellar-travel-satisfaction)**  
  *Description*: This project aims to predict customer satisfaction levels for interstellar travel. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical customer data to predict satisfaction scores based on various travel characteristics.  
  *Highlights*: 
    - **Personalized Travel Design**: Users can design their own interstellar trip by selecting various features such as destination, trip duration, class of travel, and more.
    - **Customer Satisfaction Prediction**: After designing their trip, users can obtain a prediction of the customer satisfaction level for that particular journey.
    - **Data Visualization**: Provides visualization of the distribution of predictions made by the machine learning model.
    - **Technologies Used**: Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.



- **[Relational Database Creation Project](https://github.com/aliciamb86/Relational-Database-Creation)**  
  *Description*: This project involves creating a relational database from provided data. The data pertains to a group of students from a bootcamp school along with the faculty. This project offers hands-on experience in designing relational databases from unnormalized input data, a key skill in data management and database administration.  
  *Highlights*: 
    - **Relational Diagram**: Visual representation of how entities relate to each other, how their relationships work, and where these relationships can be improved.
    - **Logical Model**: Developed a logical model comprising 11 tables to correctly manage information and avoid N:M relationships to prevent data insertion inconsistencies.
    - **Database Hosting**: Set up a server using Render to host the database.
    - **Technologies Used**: PostgreSQL, Render (for database hosting)


- **[Generative AI: FastAPI CineAPI](https://github.com/aliciamb86/API-movie-recommendations)**  
  *Description*: This project is an API developed with FastAPI that provides movie recommendations and allows data ingestion to build a query history.  
  *Highlights*: 
    - **Request Recommendation**: Users can send a movie-related question via the `/pedir_recomendacion` route and receive a recommendation generated by an AI language model.
    - **Data Ingestion**: Users can submit question and answer data to the server via the `/ingesta_datos` route. This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database to maintain a query history.
    - **History**: The `/historial` route displays a history of stored queries from the database, including the query ID, question, and answer.
    - **Technologies Used**: FastAPI (for building the API), OpenAI (for the language model), PostgreSQL (for database storage), Docker (for containerization).


- **[Sales Prediction API](https://github.com/aliciamb86/API-sales-prediction)**
